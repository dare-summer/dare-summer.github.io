abstract: > 
  In this lecture we focus on the problem of conflict resolution in the context of data management systems.
  We overview different contexts in which conflict resolution is a key issue, from groupware to geo-replicated and
  local-first systems, and discuss the requirements and techniques used, from simple last-writer-wins registers to
  CRDTs.
