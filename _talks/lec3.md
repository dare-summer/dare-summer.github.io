abstract: > 
  Distributed systems are difficult to design, implement, and test. They must ensure correctness in the concurrent execution of a distributed set of processes, different delivery orderings of asynchronous messages, and in the existence of network and process failures. Unforeseen interleavings of concurrent events and faults can result in expected malfunctioning or outages, and it is important to detect and diagnose them.
  In this tutorial, we will discuss concurrency and fault-tolerance bugs in distributed systems and introduce state-of-the-art testing techniques for efficiently detecting concurrency and fault-tolerance bugs in distributed system implementations.
