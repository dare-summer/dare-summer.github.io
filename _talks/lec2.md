abstract: > 
  In distributed systems, processes need to cooperate by exchanging information. Broadcast algorithms are a fundamental abstraction for this information exchange. This lecture will discuss different variants of broadcast algorithms and their properties concerning process failure and message ordering.
  We will further see how to implement and reason about these algorithms in a compositional way.
