abstract: >
  Chats allow to broadcast information among a group of persons. In this practical session, we will experiment how different broadcast algorithms influence the order in which messages are delivered to the chat participants. To this end, you will learn the basics of processes and message passing in Elixir (https://elixir-lang.org/) and implement a simple chat application.
