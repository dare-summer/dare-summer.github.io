### Target Audience

- Targeted to master and PhD students in Computer Science
- Blended programme with one in-person week at VUB
- Credits: 3 ECTS

### Who can attend?

DARE 2023 is aimed at researchers, masterâ€™s and Ph.D. students working in the field of distributed systems and programming languages. An undergraduate concurrency and distributed systems course is all the background needed.

Students from NOVA University of Lisbon, TU Munich, and University of Porto are eligible for an Erasmus+ mobility grant to cover their expenses. Contact the organizers of each university (listed at the end of this page) for further information.

Students from a partner university may also be eligible for a similar grant (an overview of the partner universities is available [here](https://www.vub.be/en/studying-vub/all-study-programmesvub/personal-development-during-your-studies/studying-abroad/eu-destinations-erasmusexchange/exchange-outgoing-in-computer-science-vub#paragraph-83432) ). Contact us for further information.


### When does DARE 2023 start and end?

DARE 2023 is organized as a blended learning experience. Students will first meet online in August 2023 for an introductory session before the in-person week at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) from Monday 11th September 2023 to Friday 15th, September 2023. After the in-person week, the Summer School will have a closing session later in September 2023. The evaluation consists of a small research project determined during the in-person week, which needs to be orally defended during the closing session.

Upon successful completion of the DARE 2023 Summer School (3 ECTS), VUB will issue a transcript of records. Students participating under the Erasmus+ program can receive recognition of the 3 ECTS according to the conditions outlined in their learning agreement. Self-funded participants can verify recognition options with their home university.

### Program

DARE 2023 focuses on techniques for supporting highly available distributed systems. The school combines theory and practice. Through lectures by active researchers in the field, students will get acquainted with state-of-the-art techniques and the latest research advances. Moreover, in hands-on sessions, students can also develop and experiment with existing frameworks.

The prospective topics to be covered in this edition include:

- Introduction to highly available distributed systems
- Designing and implementing replicated data types
- Verification techniques for highly available systems
- Broadcast algorithms
- Testing and debugging distributed systems
- Programming models for replicated distributed systems
- Byzantine fault-tolerance
  
A more detailed program will become available at a later stage.
