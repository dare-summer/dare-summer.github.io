>   We would like to thank all the speakers and students for attending the first Summer School on Distributed and Replicated Environments (DARE 2023). Thank you all for making DARE'23 such a special and successful event. This event would not have been the same without the enthusiasm of the students and the kindness of the speakers. We hope DARE'23 inspired you all, and we wish you the best.
