#### Wednesday 14/09: **Welcome reception** with beer tasting

**Location:** VUB Building I Atrium. 

After a brief introduction, you will have 5 blind beer tastings. Why blind? Because you first discover the art of tasing beer
and concentrate on the product aspects.

#### Thursday 15/09: Guided visit to the Brussels Hotel de Ville
**Location:** Grand Place, Brussels.  

On the second evening of MPLR, we will visit the Brussels City Hall in the world-renowned square Grand-Place, part of the UNESCO World Heritage since 1998.
This square is considered by UNESCO “an outstanding example of the eclectic and highly successful blending of architectural and artistic styles that characterizes the culture and society of this region”. It “illustrates in an exceptional way the evolution and achievements of a highly successful mercantile city of northern Europe at the height of its prosperity”.
Particularly imposing due to the size of its tower, the Brussels City Hall quickly catches the eye of visitors with its remarkable sculpted decorations and its asymmetrical facade. Walking in front of this prestigious building, you might spot newlyweds celebrating their union on the balconies.
As part of our social event, you will get a guided tour of the interiors of this majestic 15th century building.

The tour will be followed by the *conference banquet* in one of the local restaurants in the restaurant "Le Rossini".
