bio: 
    Marc Shapiro's research focuses on the theory and practice of consistency in distributed systems, and on principled approaches to computer system design and implementation. Early in his career, he invented the now-ubiquitous proxy concept. In 2009–2011, he co-invented Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), a class of replicated data types that rigorously ensure convergence, while maintaining availability.
    Dr Shapiro is an Distinguished Research Scholar (DRCE) Emeritus from Inria, in the Regal group of Sorbonne-Université-LIP6. He did his PhD at U. Paul Sabatier in Toulouse, followed by a post-doc at MIT, research positions at CMIRH and Inria, and a sabbatical at Cornell.

    In his academic career, he has a history of collaboration with industry. He led the Cambridge Distributed Systems group at Microsoft Research Cambridge (UK) for six years. He led the SyncFree European project for highly-available cloud computing and storage, developing the Antidote planet-scale hybrid-consistency database. He authored over 100 international publications in prestigious venues, 18 recognised software systems, and five patents.

    Dr. Shapiro sat on the PE6/Informatics Panel of the ERC for eight years. A Senior Member of the ACM, is known for his dedication to organising the Informatics community and making its voice heard in Europe. He was instrumental in creating the EuroSys Chapter of the ACM, the EuroSys Conference, and the ACM Europe Council.
