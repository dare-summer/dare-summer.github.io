## Venue

<hr>

DARE 2023 will be hosted by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium.


Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) is an internationally oriented university in Brussels, the heart of Europe. The VUB combines award-winning research and accredited English and Dutch-taught study programmes (Bachelors, Masters and PhDs) with high impact on social, economic and cultural innovation. VUB originated from the French speaking Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), that was founded in 1834 by a Brussels’ lawyer with Flemish roots, Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen. It was his intention to create a university independent of church and state at which academic freedom would roam. This is today still reflected in the university's motto Scientia vincere tenebras. The law of May 28th, 1970 legally confirmed the administrative, legal and scientific division of the old university into a Dutch speaking (VUB) university and French speaking (ULB) university. DARE 2023 will be hosted at the The Brussels Humanities, Sciences & Engineering Campus located in Elsene, on the border with Etterbeek and Oudergem and next to sister university ULB.

**Location:** VUB Building I. Pleinlaan, 2 1050 Brussels, Belgium
