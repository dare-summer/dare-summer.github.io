## Registration

We are aiming to gather a group of maximum 30 motivated and enthusiastic master's or PhD students with a background in computer science and distributed systems.

Participants need to fill in an application form by 15 May 2024. We will select participants based on the screening of a motivation statement, transcripts, and curriculum vitae. We will notify applicants by 24 May 2024. Accepted participants will be invited to join and register for the Summer School.

Accepted participants eligible for an Erasmus+ grant will need to then register their mobility via a dedicated Erasmus+ mobility site. The rest of the participants will directly receive a link to the payment site. There is no application fee.

### How much does it cost?
Students awarded with an Erasmus+ grant do not need to pay a registration fee (only accommodation if opted in).

For Students without an Erasmus grant, the registration fee is 400€.

We have pre-reserved hotel rooms that cost 350€ per room, (so 175€ per person when sharing the 2-person hotel rooms).




## Venue

DARE 2024 will be hosted by the [Technical University Darmstadt, Germany](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/).

Darmstadt is easy to reach via plane, travel to Frankfurt Airpoprt (FRA) and then take the [Airliner](https://www.heagmobibus.de/de/airliner) to Darmstadt Luisenplatz (this is a direct connection from the Airport to the city center).

Alternatively, Darmstadt is also well-connected via train, often via Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof then connecting to Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof.
