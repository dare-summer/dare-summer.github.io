### Registration

We are aiming to gather a group of maximum 30 motivated and enthusiastic master's or PhD students with a background in computer science and distributed systems.

Participants need to fill in an application form by 15 May 2023. We will select participants based on the screening of a motivation statement, transcripts, and curriculum vitae. We will notify applicants by 24 May 2023. Accepted participants will be invited to join and register for the Summer School.

Accepted participants eligible for an Erasmus+ grant will need to then register their mobility via a dedicated Erasmus+ mobility site. The rest of the participants will directly receive a link to the payment site. There is no application fee.

<!-- You can apply below. -->

### How much does it cost?
Once accepted, students will need to pay a registration fee. We offer three registration fee options.

- Summer school fee with NO accommodation - €350
- Summer school fee with SHARED accommodation (sharing with a person of the same gender) - €618
- Summer school fee with SINGLE room accommodation - €881

All registration fees will include lunches and coffee breaks, welcome and poster receptions, a group dinner, materials, and other activities ( e.g., a guided tour of Brussels and a museum visit).

For the registration fee options with accommodation, students will be hosted in 2-person studios.  Towels are included, but breakfast is not included. See <a href="https://soft.vub.ac.be/dare23/location/"> the accomodation section </a> for further info.

Please note that travel costs to and from Belgium are not included in the registration fees.

Students awarded with an Erasmus+ grant do not need to pay a registration fee (only accommodation if opted in), so they will receive a 350 euro discount on the chosen option.
